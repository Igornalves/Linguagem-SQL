## Database and SQL Language

Repository with the aim of studying and learning completely, from beginning to advanced, about the SQL language used in databases so that I can develop intuitive projects for companies and also solve database problems.

## A little about the Database

Well, I choose two databases to carry out this training and learning, which are the databases:

<div align="center" style="display: inline_block">
     <img align="center" alt="mysql" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/mysql/mysql-original.svg">
    <img align="center" alt="PostgreSql" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/postgresql/postgresql-original.svg">
</div>
<br>

The choice to use it was because they are the most used when it comes to relational databases, which are widely used in the market.

## Tool for database manipulation

I chose the tool called dbeaver to make the SQL Script connection with the database to make the code completely.

<div align="center" style="display: inline_block">
<img align="center" alt="dbeaver" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/dbeaver/dbeaver-original.svg">
</div>
